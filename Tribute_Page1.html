				Akiane Kramarik began drawing at the age of four. Kramarik is a self-taught painter and says that Jesus spoke to her when she was four years old, encouraging her to draw and paint her visions. She began to draw at the age of four, was painting at six, and began to write poetry at seven.<br><br>
				At the age of 8 years old, Akiane painted Jesus. Her first completed self-portrait sold for US$10,000. Kramarik's best-known painting is Prince of Peace, which she completed at the age of eight. It is her "favorite portrait" and one of her most memorable paintings.<br><br>
				Akiane had long been seeking the right face to help her paint an image from her dreams and visions when a family friend brought to her a carpenter as a possible subject. The man's face closely resembled what Kramarik remembered as the face of Jesus. She completed the portrait in 40 hours of intensive work. Not long after, it was shipped to her agent for exhibition, who stole it and sold it without permission. For sixteen years the original painting was held locked in a bank vault, with the then owner unwilling either to show or to sell it. In December 2019, Prince of Peace was recovered by the artist's family and sold to a private collector for $850,000.
